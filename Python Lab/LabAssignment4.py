# Problem Statement

# Write a Program to print list of duplicates from a list of integers [10, 20, 30, 20, 20, 30, 40, 50, -20, 60, 60, -20, -20].


# Instructions

# Write proper comment to make your code readable.
# Use proper naming convention for variables etc in your code.
# Ensure your code compiles without any errors/warning/deprecations 
# Avoid too many & unnecessary usage of white spaces (newline, spaces, tabs, â€¦)
# Always test the code thoroughly, before saving/submitting exercises/project.
